    <section name="Mapping">
      <p>
          <code>org.mybatis.scala.mapping</code> is the main package of the API, this provides all idioms needed to
          declare ResultMaps and Statements.
        </p>
      <subsection name="ResultMap">
        <p>
          To declare a ResultMap, just extend ResultMap[T] and call its mapping methods in its main constructor.</p>
          <source><![CDATA[val personResultMap = new ResultMap[Person] {
    id ( property="id", column="pid" )
    result ( property="name" column="full_name" )
}]]></source>
        <p>
          You can define contructor args, properties, associations, collections, discriminators, ...
          Look at the scaladoc for furter details of ResultMap construction.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can declare your ResultMaps wherever you want, you will reference them later when you declare
          your mapped statements.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Mapped Statements">
        <p>
          There are four types of Mapped Statements as you know: Select, Insert, Update and Delete. But Select is
          a special case with three subtypes: SelectOne, SelectList and SelectMap.
        </p>
        <p>
          To define/declare a mapped statement you just have to extend one of the Statement types and set the
          desired properties.
        </p>
      </subsection>

      <subsection name="Select">
        <p>
          For example, if you want to select a User by its id:
        </p>
          <source><![CDATA[val findUserById = new SelectOneBy[Int,User] {
    def xsql = <xsql>SELECT * from user WHERE id = {"id"?}</xsql>
}

// this is also valid
val findUserById = new SelectOneBy[Int,User] {
    def xsql =
        <xsql>
            SELECT *
            FROM user
            WHERE id = {"id"?}
        </xsql>
}]]></source>
        <p>
          You can also select a list of users filtered by its name
        </p>
          <source><![CDATA[val findUsers = new SelectListBy[String,User] {
    def xsql =
        <xsql>
            SELECT *
            FROM user
            WHERE name LIKE {"name"?}
        </xsql>
}]]></source>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Insert, Update, Delete">
        <p>
          The same applies to these statement types, just extends and define.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example
        </p>
            <source><![CDATA[val insertNewUser = new Insert[User] {
    keyGenerator = JdbcGeneratedKey(null, "id")
    def xsql =
        <xsql>
            INSERT INTO user(name, username, password)
            VALUES ({"name"?}, {"username"?}, {"password"?})
        </xsql>
}]]></source>

        <p>
          All the mapping code is disconnected, so you can put it in a static initializer (scala object)
          or wherever you want.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="Parameter binding syntax">
        <p>
          There are two syntaxes: Textual notation and Scala notation, lets see

        </p>
        <h3>Textual notation</h3>
        <p>
          The former mybatis notation can be used here escaping '{' and '}' chars.
          <source>
            SELECT *
            FROM ....
            WHERE field = #{{param}}
          </source>
          <source>
            SELECT *
            FROM ....
            WHERE field = #{{param, jdbcType=VARCHAR, mode=IN}}
          </source>
          In this case VARCHAR and IN are just strings that will be parsed at runtime.

        </p>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Scala notation</h3>
        <p>
          You can import <b>org.mybatis.scala.mapping.Binding._</b> and use the ? function. It provides
          type safety on binding attributes.
          <source>
            SELECT *
            FROM ....
            WHERE field = {"param"?}
          </source>
          <source>
            SELECT *
            FROM ....
            WHERE field = {? ("param", jdbcType=JdbcType.VARCHAR, mode=ModeIN, typeHandler=T[CustomTHandler]) }
          </source>
          In this case JdbcType.VARCHAR and ModeIN are true object references and CustomTHandler is a type reference, so they will be checked at compile time.

        </p>
